## Usage Guidelines

### Custom CSS Variables
The new design system uses CSS variables that can be customized:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #ff8800;
  --secondary-color: #343a40;
  --accent-color: #ffc107;
  --light-bg: #f8f9fa;
  --dark-bg: #212529;
  --text-color: #212529;
  --light-text: #f8f9fa;
  --border-radius: 8px;
  --box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  --hover-transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
```

### Component Classes
Use these classes to maintain consistent styling:
- `product-card`: For product display cards
- `add-to-cart-btn`: For primary action buttons
- `btn-primary-custom`: For custom primary buttons
- `fade-in`: For elements that should animate in
- `hero-section`: For full-width banners
- `footer-link`: For footer navigation links

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Add a product detail page redesign** that matches the new aesthetic
2. **Create category landing pages** with the new hero section pattern
3. **Implement skeleton loaders** instead of spinner for better UX
4. **Add micro-interactions** for buttons and interactive elements
5. **Create a dark mode theme** using the CSS variables system

## How To Test

1. Launch the application and observe the improved homepage with hero banner
2. Test the responsive behavior across different screen sizes
3. Check hover effects on product cards and buttons
4. Verify that the search box styling works properly
5. Test the cart functionality with the redesigned UI

The design is now more professional, cohesive, and provides a better shopping experience.
